<b>I am a hands-on full-stack engineering/operations leader</b> who loves the Internet.

My roots are in backend/ops but lately I've been more interested in frontend and open-source.

I know enough about running and scaling systems and content stores to be happy to let Amazon do it.

For fun I code in Python or JavaScript.

I've led teams of 100+ engineers at Akamai and VMware, and small teams at Ning, Stanford, and Wavefront.

I built and launched an
<a href="https://github.com/Stanford-Online/class2go">open-source MOOC platform</a>
in eleven weeks.

Once I had a
<a href="http://sef.kloninger.com/2012/05/engineering-culture-litmus-tests/">blog post</a>
hit the Hacker News top spot.

BS Computer Science, Stanford 1993.
